# <p style="text-align: center;">Echo</p>

## Overview
Echo is a new project that aims to utilize OpenAI’s Whisper (voice recognition) to listen to meetings and create summaries/meeting minutes. It aims to lessen the pressure on people in important meetings where it is crucial to take notes. This allows people to listen attentively to others.

## Goals
1. To learn how to utilize OpenAI’s Whisper API and integrate it into a project

2. Use Whisper to create transcripts for meetings and convert them into meeting minutes

3. Create a usable interface for users and allow them to change transcription formatting

4. Host our project for users

## Milestones 
### June
- Research OpenAI and Whisper
- Learn how to implement the API
- Determine tech stack
- Possibly start coding
### July
- Create base plate interface, simple enough to test the API and nothing more
- Start implementing the API
- Use Whisper to transcribe meetings
- Convert transcribed meetings to meeting minutes
- Start making UI
### August
- Touch up and finish UI, make it more user-friendly
- Allow users to prompt the AI on how they want the meeting minutes formatted
