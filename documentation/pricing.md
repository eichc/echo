### Give a (short) justification for your request. What are you trying to accomplish? How will this resource help you? Why should RCOS support this request?
We are requesting OpenAI API credits. Our application uses Whisper to convert recordings into transcriptions, and GPT to convert the transcripts to meeting minutes. Both of these key features require access to the API. The goal of our project is for the application to listen to meetings and generate summaries, making it easier for people to pay attention during meetings without worrying about taking notes.

### What is your anticipated cost? Is it a one time cost or would it be ongoing? Over what period is this cost?
For an example pricepoint, consider a 5 minute recording which transcribes into 750 words and generates a summary of 250 words. The cost of the API calls for this would be about $0.07 in total. During the testing stages of the application, our recordings will likely be shorter, so $10 of credits could probably allow us to do 200-250 complete tests of the application. We anticipate using this for the duration of the semester, and then reevaluating before the Fall. All pricing information is available at <https://openai.com/api/pricing/>
